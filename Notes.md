- When we need to make a certain line end with a character other than new line '\n' then use ",end("character")" after the print command
- To print a string as it is we can prefix an r to the string to show that it is a raw string
- For python every single physical line is a logical line unless you put a ';' at the end of a line which would mean that you can have multiple logical lines on a single physical line.
- '//' is used to divde and round the number down
- In Python we can have an 'else' clause for a while statement
- We should always add a ':' at the end of every control statement
- There is no limit for the size of ints in Python
- When the curly brances are used in the print statement then it is necessary to use the format function to get the output properly
