This is a repository to store all the files that I would be generating while studying Python in my free time. There are mainly 2 resources that I would be using to learn this extremely general purpose and useful language. These resources are listed below:
- A Byte of Python - Swaroop CH [free book on Github [http://github.com/swaroopch/byte-of-python]]
- Code School - Try Python [10 hour free course]
